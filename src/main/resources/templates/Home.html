<p style="font-size: 20px">Welcome to Glass Dome!<br> <br> This website will be a place to learn about teachers and
    courses you haven't had at Holy Names and give feedback on the ones you have.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 40px"> About Us </h2>
<p style ="color: maroon"> 	Seattle based students Julia Hopper and Claire Mattingly are current Holy Names Academy
    seniors (class of 2021- Go skippers!)
<br>
    Outside of school Julia likes to spend her time rowing and sleeping, and she has a dog named Tilly.
    Claire enjoys theater and dance, and likes to bake! </P>

<h3 style = "font-size: 40px">Mission </h3>
<p style = "color: maroon">After experiencing the fast paced classes at Holy Names, and seeing friends struggle with getting the support they needed
    we saw a clear need for an avenue of consistent feedback for teachers and courses. Glass Dome is a place for students to share their experiences
    with teachers and one another- so our whole community can grow and flourish. <br><br><br><br>
