<h1>Glass Dome</h1>

<p> Welcome to Glass Dome!<br> <br> This website will be a place to learn about teachers and
    courses you haven't had at Holy Names and give feedback on the ones you have.</p>


<h2>About Us </h2>
<p> Seattle based students Julia Hopper and Claire Mattingly are current Holy Names Academy
    seniors (class of 2021- Go skippers!)
<br>
    Outside of school Julia likes to spend her time rowing and sleeping, and she has a dog named Tilly.
    Claire enjoys theater and dance, and likes to bake! </p>

<h3> Mission </h3>
<p>After experiencing the fast paced classes at Holy Names, and seeing friends struggle with getting the support they needed
    we saw a clear need for an avenue of consistent feedback for teachers and courses. Glass Dome is a place for students to share their experiences
    with teachers and one another- so our whole community can grow and flourish. <br><br><br><br>
     </p>
