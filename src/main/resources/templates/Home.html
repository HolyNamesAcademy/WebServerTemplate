<p style ="color: maroon"> Julia and Claire are two Holy Names seniors from the class of 2021. (Go skippers!)</P>

<h3 style = "font-size: 40px">Mission </h3>
<p style = "color: maroon">After experiencing the fast paced classes at Holy Names, and seeing friends struggle with getting the support they needed
    we saw a clear need for an avenue of consistent feedback for teachers and courses. Glass Dome is a place for students to share their experiences
    with teachers and one another- so our whole community can grow and flourish.
